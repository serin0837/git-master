# programming essentials

## computer?

1930s has taken off
machines that can perform calculations and operations on data.

hardware : physical stuff like keyboard

software: systems take input and give you output
(not physical stuff)
the set of instructions written to be processed(01001 stuff) and executed by the hardware that makes up a computer

## operating systems

`programs that manage with the different software`

mordern computers often have to run several applications at the same time.

each applications are made up of software

software will require access to the physical resources of the computer in order to run.

Operating systems are essentially master programs that manage and co-ordinate the different software and how they get access to the physical hardware of a computer.

### unix

unix is first operating system in 1960

many operating systems today are said to be unix-lie system
ex) Mac OS
ex) Linux (1990s)

### DOS

Windows operating system emerged from the MS-DOS (MicroSoft Disk Operating System).

The main difference between MS-DOS and Unix is that MS-DOS was designed for a single user.

## interacting with a computer

a set of instruction -> computer

refer this set of instruction that a computer executes as a computer program

**Execute** in this context means the machine carrying out the set of instructions contained within some computer program. (?)

users can issue commands to the computer.

terminal is a computer interface that is used for entering text command

\*A **console** is a set of tools that are used to operate a machine. In the context of computers, a **console** comprises all the tools used to operate a machine, such as the **terminal** and the keyboard you use in order to type commands into the **terminal**. However, sometimes the terms **console** and **terminal** are used interchangeably.

## shells

A terminal allows users to input commands but this application doesn't know what to do with the command itself.

A shell is a program that interprets commands and executes a program that will carry out the task.

A shell is a **command line interpreter**

### Bash

Bash is both a **command line interpreter** and a **programming language**.

ex)

### `echo` command

We can start to enter commmands into the **terminal** and bash will interpret and execute these commands and then finally send some text output back to the terminal. One of the most basic commands we can use is `echo`:

## file system

Collections of data are organised into groups called `files`

A **directory** is a container for multiple files and directories.
`directory is folder`
data-> file ->directory ->directory

### Nagivating the file system

`pwd` which stands for **print working directory**

(not really sure about working directory)

A **file path** is a list of different directories separated by a `/`, indicating which `directory` the shell program is currently inside.

### ls (list directory contents)

which folders and directories are currently inside of the current directory.

### cd (change directory)

also go to home directory

### start . (open directory)

### mkdir (make directory)

### rmdir (delete directory)

### touch (make file)

### rm (remove files and directories)

#### unix style code
